# ðŸ“˜ LeetCode75Solutions

A modern take on solving the [LeetCode 75 Study Plan](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/) â€” not just through code, but also with visual, interactive **UWP (Universal Windows Platform)** interfaces.

## What This Project Is

This repository includes two main projects:

### 1. `LeetCode75Solutions.ClassLibrary`
Contains efficient and clean C# solutions to problems from the LeetCode 75 list.
- Problems are organized in folders like `ArrayStringProblems`, `LinkedListProblems`, etc.
- Each folder matches the official study plan grouping.
- Solutions are implemented using standard .NET/C# practices.

### 2. `LeetCode75Solutions.UWP`
A Windows UWP application that provides a **visual interface** to interact with the problem solutions.
- Each algorithm is linked to its own dedicated page.
- Navigation is handled via a dictionary (`ProblemPages.cs`) mapping titles to UWP pages.
- The `MainPage` displays a list of problems for easy access.
